  %p This list specifies members who have filled in a membership form for this year but have not been confirmed as having paid up yet.
  %p
    For these applications, if they resubmit the membership form again or choose not to join the club, this record can be removed using the
    %b Destroy
    button.
  %p
    If the refence specifies
    %b Paypal
    under the Amount column, that means their Paypal transaction was incomplete. In this case, a club officer needs to follow them up directly for payment.

    %b Acknowledge Payment
    button. If cash is received by a club representative officer, the member can also be endorsed using this
